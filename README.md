# Complex-Engineering-Problem
This was the semester project for the course Analog and Digital Communication. It is an engineering problem with two parts. Part one included modelling an FM radio with a superheterodyne receiver. Part 2 included BPSK digital modulation of text messages, demodulated using correlation-type demodulator.
